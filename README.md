## Project Overview:
This project focuses on binary classification of rice grains into two varieties: Cammeo and Osmancik. The dataset consists of 3,810 rice grains, each characterized by 7 morphological features extracted from images using computer vision techniques. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify rice grains based on these features.

Binary classification
## In this project, I have completed the following tasks:
1. Examine a dataset containing measurements derived from images of two species of Turkish rice.
2. Create a binary classifier to sort grains of rice into the two species.
3. Evaluate the performance of the model.
4. Learning objectives

## By completing this project, I have learn:
1. How to train a binary classifier.
2. How to calculate metrics for a binary classifier at different thresholds.
3. How to compare AUC and ROC of two different models
